This repo proposes two new distance measures, called functional Ward's linkages, for functional data clustering that are robust against outliers. Conventional Ward’s linkage defines the distance between two clusters as the increase in sum of squared errors (SSE) upon merging, which can be interpreted graphically as an increase in cluster diameter. Analogously, functional Ward’s linkage defines the distance between two clusters as the increase in the width of the band after merging them. To address the limitations of conventional Ward's linkage in handling outliers and contamination, the proposed linkages focus exclusively on the most central curves by leveraging magnitude-shape outlyingness measures and modified band depth, respectively.
